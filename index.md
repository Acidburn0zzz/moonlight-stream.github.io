#Limelight

Limelight is an open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream. We reverse
engineered the protocol used by the NVIDIA Shield and reimplemented the entire
thing.

Limelight has implementations for most major platforms, and streams your
collection of steam games from your
[GFE compatible PC](http://shield.nvidia.com/play-pc-games/) to your device
running Limelight. There is information on getting Limelight up and running in
the links below.

* [Limelight-android](https://github.com/limelight-stream/limelight-android)
  allows streaming to any compatible Android device.
* [Limelight-pc](https://github.com/limelight-stream/limelight-pc) allows
  streaming to Linux/OSX/Windows.

Limelight was initially created by [Case Western](http://case.edu) students at
the [MHacks](http://mhacks.org) hackathon.

You can follow along with Limelight development at the [XDA
Thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2505510).
